C:\telemetry3\coregen\:

core_resources.txt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

invSinc.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

invSinc.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is

   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

invSinc.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

invSincCOEFF_auto0_0.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

invSincCOEFF_auto0_1.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

invSincCOEFF_auto0_2.mif:

   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

invSinc_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

invSinc_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.

invSincfilt_decode_rom.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
