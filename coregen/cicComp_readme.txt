The following files were generated for 'cicComp' in directory 
C:\modem\telemetry\coregen\:

cicComp.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

cicComp.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

cicComp.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

cicComp.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

cicComp.v:
   Unisim Verilog file containing the information required to simulate
   the module.

cicComp.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

cicComp.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

cicCompCOEFF_auto0.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

cicCompCOEFF_auto1.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

cicCompCOEFF_auto2.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

cicComp_fir_compiler_v3_2_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

cicComp_fir_compiler_v3_2_xst_1_vhdl.prj:
   Please see the core data sheet.

cicComp_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

cicComp_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

cicComp_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.

cicCompfilt_decode_rom.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

core_resources.txt:
